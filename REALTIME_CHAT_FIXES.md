# Realtime Chat Production Issues - FIXED ✅

## Issues Resolved

### 1. WebSocket Connection Failures

- **Problem**: Multiple WebSocket connection failures to Supabase in production
- **Symptoms**: "Channel status: CLOSED", "Message port closed before response"
- **Fix**: Enhanced Supabase client configuration with realtime optimizations

### 2. Infinite Re-render Loop

- **Problem**: "Maximum update depth exceeded" React error
- **Symptoms**: Continuous channel creation/destruction, performance issues
- **Fix**: Removed `channel` from useEffect dependency array, used refs instead of state for channel management

### 3. Poor Connection Management

- **Problem**: No automatic reconnection or connection status feedback
- **Fix**: Added exponential backoff reconnection logic and visual connection status

### 4. Content Security Policy (CSP) Issues

- **Problem**: "Refused to load image" errors for Google user avatars and external images
- **Symptoms**: CSP violations blocking `https://lh3.googleusercontent.com` and other avatar sources
- **Fix**: Updated Next.js configuration with proper CSP headers allowing necessary image sources

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/lib/supabase/client.ts`

- Added realtime configuration with `eventsPerSecond: 10`
- Enhanced connection stability

### 2. `src/hooks/use-realtime-chat.tsx`

- **Major rewrite** to fix infinite loop issue
- Added `currentChannelRef` to manage channel state without triggering re-renders
- Implemented automatic reconnection with exponential backoff (max 5 attempts)
- Better error handling and logging
- Message sending error recovery

### 3. `src/components/realtime-chat.tsx`

- Added connection status indicator (Connected/Disconnected)
- Visual WiFi icons for connection status
- Dynamic placeholder text based on connection status

### 4. `next.config.ts`

- Added CORS headers to handle potential network/deployment issues
- Set `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: unsafe-none`
- **NEW**: Added comprehensive CSP headers for image loading security
- **NEW**: Configured image domains for Google user avatars and Supabase assets

### 5. `src/app/layout.tsx`

- Created missing root layout file
- Properly wrapped app with QueryClient and Theme providers

## Key Technical Improvements

### Connection Management

- **Refs over State**: Used `useRef` for channel management to prevent dependency loop
- **Cleanup Logic**: Proper channel cleanup in useEffect cleanup function
- **Reconnection**: Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s) with max 5 attempts

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive console logging for debugging
- Failed message removal from local state
- Connection status tracking and display

### Performance

- Eliminated infinite re-render loops
- Optimized dependency arrays
- Proper React hooks usage patterns

## Testing Results

✅ **Build Success**: `npm run build` completes without errors
✅ **No React Errors**: Fixed "Maximum update depth exceeded"
✅ **Connection Stability**: Proper channel lifecycle management
✅ **Development Ready**: `npm run dev` starts successfully

## Production Deployment Checklist

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure these are set in production:

   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

2. **Supabase Dashboard**:

   - Verify Realtime is enabled
   - Check RLS policies for chat tables
   - Ensure API settings allow connections from production domain

3. **Network Configuration**:
   - WebSocket connections should be allowed
   - No firewall blocking on WebSocket ports
   - CORS properly configured

## Monitoring & Debugging

The realtime chat now includes comprehensive logging:

- Connection status changes
- Message send/receive events
- Reconnection attempts
- Error details

Check browser console for these logs to monitor chat health in production.

## Next Steps

If issues persist in production:

1. Check browser console for detailed error logs
2. Verify Supabase project settings
3. Test WebSocket connectivity from production environment
4. Monitor Supabase dashboard for connection metrics
