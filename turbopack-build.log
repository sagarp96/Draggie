./src/hooks/use-realtime-chat.tsx
47:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has an unnecessary dependency: 'supabase'. Either exclude it or remove the dependency array. Outer scope values like 'supabase' aren't valid dependencies because mutating them doesn't re-render the component.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./src/hooks/use-realtime-cursors.ts
